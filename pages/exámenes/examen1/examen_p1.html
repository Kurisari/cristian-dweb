                <b>&emsp;Abstract— Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have
                    been used since the late 80’s. Nevertheless, until the 2000’s when
                    they begun to be popular for image classification tasks, thanks
                    to the improvements in computation performance of electronic
                    devices and new algorithms development. However, most of the
                    classifiers are oriented towards the processing of real-world
                    images. This document presents a CNN for hand-written
                    drawings recognition. The dataset consists of 710,000 images
                    that correspond to 71 different classes, each one with around
                    10,000 samples. The dataset was randomly divided into a
                    training set (80%) and a testing set (20%). The CNN classifier
                    achieved an accuracy of 84.79% for classifying the samples on
                    the testing set. The classification results showed perfect
                    identification for 10 classes, whereas 6 classes were poorly
                    classified. It is foreseen that the results presented here can fuel
                    applications where identification of hand-made drawings are
                    critical, such as neuropsychological tests. <br><br>

                I. INTRODUCTION<br>
                &emsp;Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been applied
                to visual applications since two decades ago at least [1], [2].
                Nevertheless, besides some disperse reported applications, the
                CNN remained relatively inactive until the middle of 2000’s,
                when the developments on computational and data science,
                along with the availability of diverse databases complemented
                with advanced algorithms, lead to their rapid improvement
                and use [3]. This work aims to contribute to the CNN
                application to the classification of images based on hand-
                written drawings, an area that has been somewhat unexplored.<br>
                &emsp;Image classification can be defined as the process of image
                categorization within one or more predefined classes, and is
                one of the fundamental problems on computer vision and
                related applications, such as localization, detection and
                segmentation [4]-[7]. Image classification is an easy task for
                humans, but a difficult one for a computer. Some of the typical
                complications include object shape dependence on point-of-
                observation and object variability [8]. Now, it can be
                considered that image classification is a specific application
                of pattern recognition and classification, which is generally
                defined as the mapping over a big group of data, from which
                smaller sub-groups or classes of data can be arranged
                according to specific criteria. The pattern classification
                process is basically composed of two parts: one,
                characteristics extraction phase, and second, decision making
                or classification phase. During the characteristics extraction
                phase, the largest dimension is transformed into a set of
                metrics, termed characteristics. These metrics thus represent
            </td>
            <td style="padding: 20px;">
                intrinsic information about the patterns. One of the most
                important features of CNNs is that they include both parts of
                image classification, which means that they can perform the
                features extraction and their classification, making their
                implementation an easy task.<br>
                &emsp;Currently, most of the classifiers and convolution
                techniques aim to the processing of “real” images, i.e., images
                from scenes in the 3D world we interact. This kind of
                approaches in fact make these techniques suitable for robotic
                and automation applications. Nevertheless, an increasing
                amount of reports demonstrate the feasibility of using CNN
                for hand-written images, with interesting advances in the field
                of text and languages recognition [9]-[11]. Moreover, another
                interesting and potential field where hand-written images
                recognition and classification could have an important impact
                is human health, given the potential of automated
                interpretation of human writing or drawings from the
                psychology point of view, or more precisely, in the
                development of neuropsychological tests (NT) [12], [13].
                Some works already report the use of machine learning (ML)
                methodologies for improving the detection and diagnosis of
                neurodegenerative diseases, describing the analysis of images
                from specialized techniques such as computerized
                tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), etc.
                [14], [15]. Fortunately, ML has also been explored for easier,
                faster, and cheaper alternatives for tests and diagnosis by
                means of hand-writing recognition and classification [12],
                [16], [17]. NT represent a specialized area within clinic
                psychology. Psychologists use the contextual information
                from these tests for diverse kinds of evaluations (e.g., a child
                with learning difficulties or a patient suffering of a
                neurodegenerative disease). As it is previously mentioned,
                there are several medical procedures such as CT, MRI or
                positron-emission tomography (PET), which can show
                graphically parts of the brain with physiological disorders.
                Nonetheless, NT can reveal deep aspects of the whole brain
                functioning. Unfortunately, some of these procedures are
                lengthy, and composed of integral exams which include a
                wide variety of subtests like the Halstead-Reitan [18] or Luria-
                Nebraska [19]. One common feature of these tests is the use
                of figures or specific forms of drawings. The scoring in these
                tests are based in a variety of possible errors that the subjects
                can commit while copying the figures, including missing
                details, collision or superposition, inability of shape
                completion (such as circles or squares), disproportionate sizes
                and angles, or misorientations.<br>
                &emsp;Given that the score patterns within these subtests can be
                used for specific cognitive failures identification, an
                automated tool for hand-written drawings identification and
                classification could provide a key advantage for the

                developing of NT based on ML. As mentioned, most of the
                previous works on this topic have been oriented towards the
                recognition and classification of characters, within the
                language scope. Some seminal reports consider the
                recognition of specific features in hand-written drawings [20],
                which will be used as a basement for further develop a CNN
                strategy for drawings classification. This work aims to provide
                an efficient ML methodology for the classification of hand-
                written sketches, which would provide a solid framework for
                further developments towards their automatic interpretation.
                The results demonstrate a high potential of CNN architectures
                for drawings recognition and classification, which ultimately
                could be applied to a wide variety of tests, including NT for
                automated psychological evaluations.<br>

                description and then comes how the image classification was

                III, with the concluding remarks summarized in section IV.<br><br>
                II. METHODOLOGY<br>
                &emsp;A. Data description<br>
                &emsp;The hand-drawing images used in the experiments were
                taken from a dataset of Quick, Draw! a game that recollects
                hand-written draws from millions of users around the world.
                [21]. The dataset consists of 710,000 images that correspond
                to 71 different classes each one with around 10,000 samples.
                The list of classes are airplane, backpack, bat, beard, bee,
                bird, bush, butterfly, cactus, car, cat, cloud, cow, dog, door,
                ear, eye, eyeglasses, face, fish, flower, foot, garden, goatee,
                grass, hand, hat, helmet, horse, house, jacket, leg, lightning,
                moon, mountain, mouse, moustache, mouth, mushroom,
                necklace, nose, ocean, palm_tree, pants, pig, rabbit, raccoon,
                rain, rainbow, river, sailboat, screwdriver, sea_turtle, sheep,
                shoe, shorts, skyscraper, smiley_face, snake, sock, squirrel,
                star, sun, sweater, tent, The_Mona_Lisa, tornado, tree, t-shirt,
                umbrella, and yoga. Figure 1 shows an example of the
                images.<br><br>
                &emsp;B. Image classification<br>
                &emsp;As it is mentioned in Section I, CNNs have been
                successfully used for image classification, and its power has
                been probed in different contexts. For that reason, it was
                decided to use a CNN for the classification of drawing
                images.<br>
                &emsp;CNNs are advanced networks due to the unidirectional
                way they manage the information, from the inputs toward the
                output. CNNs are, as it occurs in general with artificial-NN
                (ANN), inspired in biological NN. The basic unit in an ANN
                is a neuron, where a set of numerical inputs 𝑥𝑖 are weighted
                by a corresponding weight 𝑤𝑖 . As can be seen in Equation 1.
                The results are added, and finally, an activation function 𝜑 is
                applied to yield the final result 𝑦 . The objective of the
                activation function is to create nonlinear models.<br><br>
                𝑦 = 𝜑(𝑤0 + ∑𝑖 𝑤𝑖 𝑥𝑖 ) (1)

                &emsp;The brain visual cortex, which consists of alternate
                neuronal layers with different complexity, constitutes a
                recurrent model for CNNs architectures. These architectures
                can thus include specific layers for specific functions as
                convolution, categorization, and sampling, grouped within
                modules of one or more neuronal layers fully connected.
                Then, a deep-CNN (DCNN) is built by stacking individual
                modules. Figure 2 shows a typical architecture of a CNN used
                for image classification; an image is provided as an input for
                the DCNN, normally consisting of several convolution and
                grouping stages. From that point, the outcomes become the
                inputs for one or more fully connected NN layers. Finally, the
                last fully connected NN layer is in charge of labeling the
                classes.

                &emsp;The total number of parameters of the CNN is 249,415.
                The optimization algorithm used for training the CNN was
                Adam [22], where the loss was defined as cross-entropy for
                maximizing the accuracy. If 𝑦 and 𝑦
                ̂
                are two vectors in ℝ𝑛
                that contain the real and predicted labels for 𝑛 samples, the
                accuracy is defined in Equations 2, where 𝜑(⋅
                ,
                ⋅) is a function
                that returns 1 if their inputs are equal or 0 otherwise. On the
                other hand, considering 𝑦 and 𝑦
                ̂ as two matrices in ℝ𝑛𝑘
                ,
                where 𝑛 are the number of samples and 𝑘 the number of
                classes. The matrix 𝑦 contains the real labels, the row 𝑖 that
                represent the sample 𝑖 has only one 1 in the column that
                corresponds to the real class, the rest of the cells in that row
                are 0. The matrix 𝑦
                ̂ contains the predicted labels that
                correspond to values between 0 and 1 that can be seen as the

                For calculating the performance of the CNN classifier, the
                images were randomly divided in 568,000 samples for
                training (80%) and 142,000 (20%) for testing. In addition,
                when training the CNN, the training set was randomly divided
                into training (90%) and validation set (10%).<br><br>
                III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<br>
                &emsp;The metric used for measuring the CNN performance is
                accuracy. It counts the percentage of labels that the classifier
                predicts correctly. Its value ranges from 0 to 1, being 1 a
                perfect prediction.<br>
                &emsp;The CNN architecture described in section II achieved an
                accuracy of 0.8479. Considering a multiclass problem of
                hand-written drawings with a high number of classes, 71 in
                this case, the obtained accuracy is quite relevant. The
                confusion matrix is visually presented in Figure 3 where, as
                it was expected, the diagonal matrix has high values, meaning
                an almost perfect identification. The classes with high
                confusion are the ones showed in Table 1. On the other hand,
            </td>
            <td style="padding: 20px;">
                the classes that were predicted with an accuracy of 1.0 were
                screwdriver, eye, rainbow, star, sun, cactus, the Mona Lisa,
                tornado, backpack, and house. It is interesting to compare
                these results with other related with hand-written drawings
                recognition by CNN. For instance, accuracies as high as 89%
                were achieved, but for a small number of classes for sketch-
                made human expressions [20]. This highlights the importance
                of this work, where 71 classes were recognized and classified.<br>
                &emsp;Figure 4 shows some incorrect classification as a result of
                the test process, but that can be considered as correct answers
                since the images really seem to be what the classifier is
                detecting on the image. This is shown in the confusion matrix,
                as it can observed in Figure 3. Most of the wrong
                classification cases are the result of various classes that have
                high similarity with others. The CNN could be improved
                reducing the classes that are similar on aspect (e.g. sweater,
                t-shirt and jacket), choosing the one with the best accuracy
                result, and reducing the number of classes from 5 to 10.

                IV. CONCLUSIONS<br>
                &emsp;This document presents a methodology based on deep
                learning for classifying hand-written drawings. The dataset
                was composed of 710,000 images of hand-written drawings of
                71 different classes. The list of classes are airplane, backpack,
                bat, beard, bee, bird, bush, butterfly, cactus, car, cat, cloud,
                cow, dog, door, ear, eye, eyeglasses, face, fish, flower, foot,
                garden, goatee, grass, hand, hat, helmet, horse, house, jacket,
                leg, lightning, moon, mountain, mouse, moustache, mouth,
                mushroom, necklace, nose, ocean, palm_tree, pants, pig,
                rabbit, raccoon, rain, rainbow, river, sailboat, screwdriver,
                sea_turtle, sheep, shoe, shorts, skyscraper, smiley_face,
            </td>
            <td style="padding: 20px;">
                snake, sock, squirrel, star, sun, sweater, tent, The_Mona_Lisa,
                tornado, tree, t-shirt, umbrella, and yoga. Each class contains
                around 10,000 samples. The dataset was randomly divided
                into training (80%) and testing set (20%).<br>
                &emsp;The classifier was proposed as a CNN composed of 8
                layers, with a total of 249,415 parameters. The optimization
                algorithm was ADAM. The performance of the classifier was
                an accuracy of 84.79%, being the following classes the one
                with a perfect performance: screwdriver, eye, rainbow, star,
                sun, cactus, the mona lisa, tornado, backpack, and house. On
                the other hand, the classes with lower performance are dog,
                sweater, raccoon, goatte, skyscraper, and cow. However, their
                performance can be explained because the labels are related.
                For example, the class dog was confused with horse and cow,
                and, the class sweater was confused with t-shirt and jacket.<br>
                &emsp;As future work, we plan to use the CNN presented in this
                document for identifying key hand-written drawings to
                interpret neuropsychological tests.<br><br>
